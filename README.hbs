## intersects
shape collision / intersects library for pixi.js

## rationale
this is a simple libary that i designed for use with my game engine. most of the better collision libraries were too large or too heavily invested in physics. i wanted something simple that worked well with pixi.js.

## Code Example

    // point-Rectangle intersection

    var sprite = new PIXI.Sprite(texture);
    sprite.shape = new Intersects.Rectangle(sprite);
    sprite.position.set(5, 5);
    if (sprite.shape.collidesPoint(new PIXI.Point(10, 10)))
    {
        console.log('intersected');
    }
